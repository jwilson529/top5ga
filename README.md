# Top 5 GA

Top 5 GA is a WordPress plugin that integrates Google Analytics (GA4) data with your WordPress site. It retrieves GA data, maps page view counts to posts (stored as post meta), and provides a shortcode to display the top posts based on GA metrics.

> **Note:** This plugin is a headstart and is not production-ready. It is intended as a starting point for developers to build upon.

## Features

- **OAuth Integration:** Connect your Google Analytics account via OAuth.
- **GA Data Retrieval:** Fetch GA accounts, properties, and detailed report data using the GA4 Data API.
- **Post Meta Mapping:** Automatically update posts with GA view counts via a cron job.
- **Shortcode:** Display the top posts based on GA data using the `[top_ga_posts]` shortcode.
- **Cron Jobs:** Scheduled tasks to refresh OAuth tokens and update post metadata.

## Usage

### Updating GA Data
- The plugin uses cron jobs to automatically refresh the OAuth token and update post metadata with GA view counts hourly.
- GA data is fetched and mapped to posts by matching the post slug with the GA page path.

### Shortcode
Display the top posts on your site by adding this shortcode to a page or widget:

```html
[top_ga_posts limit="5" post_type="post"]
